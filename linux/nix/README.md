# Notes and TODO

- Get the gruvbox theme from [here](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme) and the Grubox-Dark
  folder into ~/.icon (Should find a better way to do this)
- Try and find a way to package rotz (dotfiles manager) and also the theme
- Document the installation steps on a fresh install
